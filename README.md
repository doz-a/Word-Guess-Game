# Word Guess Game
Word Guess Game using Javascript

Sike! It changed to...

... The Psychic Game! Guess my letter, using Javascript

Featuring....

-A key capturing function that captures all letter keys! and number keys! even captures caps lock! 
-If statements that update the game based on incorrect guesses and correct guesses
-Multiple uses of .innerHTML in javascript to insert text meat into the HTML div id tacos
-Cheat code option in console that shows the letter the computer is thinking of! That's real psychicness right there
-A huge picture of mexican food because why not make you hungry for no reason! >:)



Future edits:
-Add a taco that slowly gets eaten as the guesses decrease
-Add to document.onkeyup function to only capture lowercase letters
-Add a pause? that doesnt capture key presses for a second or two after a win or loss so player is forced to stop button smashing and has time to read the instructions text
-An array for the computer to choose from that has different instructional text on how to button smash! 



Original instructions:

// 1. [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/qTc45Lox97g).

// 2. You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

// 3. Guess what letter I'm thinking of

// 4. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

// 5. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

// 6. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

// 7. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

// 8. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

// 9. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
